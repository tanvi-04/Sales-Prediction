# Overview:
<br>
# This project aims to predict sales based on advertising expenditures using linear regression. It utilizes a dataset named "Advertising.csv" containing information about advertising spending on TV, radio, and newspaper, along with corresponding sales figures.
<br>
# Dataset:
<br>
# The dataset "Advertising.csv" consists of the following columns:
<br>
# TV: advertising spending on TV (in thousands of dollars)
<br>
# Radio: advertising spending on radio (in thousands of dollars)
<br>
# Newspaper: advertising spending on newspaper (in thousands of dollars)
<br>
# Sales: sales figures (in thousands of units)
<br>
# Steps Involved:
<br>
# Data Loading and Exploration: The dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame. Basic exploratory data analysis techniques such as head(), tail(), shape, info(), and describe() are used to understand the structure and contents of the data.
<br>
# Data Preprocessing: The column "Unnamed: 0" is dropped as it does not contribute to the analysis. The dataset is split into input features (X) and target variable (y). Then, the data is split into training and testing sets using the train_test_split() function from Scikit-learn.
<br>
# Feature Scaling: Standardization is applied to the input features using StandardScaler() from Scikit-learn to ensure that all features are on a similar scale.
<br>
# Model Training: A linear regression model is trained using the training data after scaling.
<br>
# Model Evaluation: The trained model's performance is evaluated using the coefficient of determination (R-squared) metric. Additionally, a scatter plot is generated to visualize the predicted sales versus actual sales.
